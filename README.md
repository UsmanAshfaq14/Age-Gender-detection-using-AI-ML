# Age-Gender-detection-using-AI-ML

## Introduction

In this Python project, we will use Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. We will use models trained by Tal Hassner and Gil Levi. The predicted gender may be one of **Male** or **Female**, and the predicted age may fall into one of the following ranges:

- **(0 â€“ 2)**
- **(4 â€“ 6)**
- **(8 â€“ 12)**
- **(15 â€“ 20)**
- **(25 â€“ 32)**
- **(38 â€“ 43)**
- **(48 â€“ 53)**
- **(60 â€“ 100)**

*(8 nodes in the final softmax layer)*

Accurately guessing an exact age from a single image is challenging due to factors such as makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. Therefore, we formulate this as a classification problem rather than a regression task.

## The CNN Architecture

The convolutional neural network for this project consists of:

- **3 Convolutional Layers:**
  - **Layer 1:** 96 nodes, kernel size 7
  - **Layer 2:** 256 nodes, kernel size 5
  - **Layer 3:** 384 nodes, kernel size 3

- **2 Fully Connected Layers:**
  - Each with 512 nodes

- **Final Output Layer:**
  - Softmax type layer for classification

## Project Workflow

To implement the project, we will:

1. **Detect faces**
2. **Classify into Male/Female**
3. **Classify into one of the 8 age ranges**
4. **Overlay the results on the image and display it**

## The Dataset

For this project, we will use the **Adience dataset**. This dataset:

- Is available in the public domain.
- Serves as a benchmark for face photos under various real-world conditions such as noise, lighting, pose, and appearance.
- Contains **26,580 photos** of **2,284 subjects** across eight age ranges.
- Is approximately **1GB** in size.

The models employed have been trained on this dataset. The images, collected from Flickr albums, are distributed under the Creative Commons (CC) license.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **OpenCV (cv2):**

  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

- Other required packages include `math` and `argparse`, which are part of the standard Python library.

## Steps for Practicing Gender and Age Detection

### 1. Setup

- **Download** the project zip file.
- **Unzip** the file and place its contents in a directory (e.g., `gad`).

#### Contents of the Zip File

- `opencv_face_detector.pbtxt`
- `opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb`
- `age_deploy.prototxt`
- `age_net.caffemodel`
- `gender_deploy.prototxt`
- `gender_net.caffemodel`
- A few sample pictures for testing

> **Note:**  
> - The `.pb` file is a protobuf file containing the graph definition and trained weights for face detection.  
> - The `.pbtxt` file holds the same in text format (TensorFlow).  
> - For age and gender detection, the `.prototxt` files define the network configuration, and the `.caffemodel` file contains the trained model weights.

### 2. Argument Parsing

- Use the `argparse` library to create an argument parser.
- Parse the command-line argument for the image path to classify gender and age.

### 3. Initialize Models

- Initialize the protocol buffers and load the models for face, age, and gender detection.

### 4. Set Mean Values and Labels

- Set the mean values for preprocessing.
- Define the lists for age ranges and gender labels.

### 5. Load the Networks

- Use the `readNet()` method to load the networks:
  - The first parameter provides the trained weights.
  - The second parameter contains the network configuration.

### 6. Capture Video Stream (Optional)

- Capture a video stream if you wish to classify live input from a webcam.
- Set the padding to **20**.

### 7. Process the Video Stream

- Continuously read frames until a key is pressed.
- Use `waitKey()` from OpenCV (`cv2`) to handle frame processing.

### 8. Face Detection

- Call the `highlightFace()` function with the `faceNet` model and the current frame.
- The function returns:
  - `resultImg`: The image with detected faces highlighted.
  - `faceBoxes`: A list containing coordinates of detected faces.

**Detection Process:**

- Create a shallow copy of the frame.
- Retrieve the imageâ€™s dimensions.
- Create a blob from the image copy.
- Set the blob as input and perform a forward pass through the network.
- Loop over potential detections (e.g., indices 0 to 127) and, if the confidence (between 0 and 1) exceeds **0.7**, record the face coordinates (`x1, y1, x2, y2`) and append them to `faceBoxes`.
- Draw rectangles on the image for each set of coordinates.

### 9. Gender and Age Classification

- For each detected face in `faceBoxes`:
  - Extract the face region and create a 4-dimensional blob (with scaling, resizing, and mean subtraction).
  - Feed the blob to the gender detection network and choose the class with the higher confidence as the predicted gender.
  - Repeat the process for age detection.

### 10. Display Results

- Overlay the predicted gender and age on the image.
- Display the final image using `imshow()` from OpenCV.
